@book{Flanagan2006a,
abstract = {JavaScript is a powerful, object-based scripting language; JavaScript programs can be embedded directly in HTML web pages. When combined with the Document Object Model (DOM) defined by a web browser, JavaScript allows you to create Dynamic HTML content and interactive client-side web applications. JavaScript syntax is based on the popular programming languages C, C++, and Java, which makes it familiar and easy to learn for experienced programmers. At the same time, JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language, providing a flexible, forgiving programming environment in which new programmers can learn. "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" provides a thorough description of the core JavaScript language and both the legacy and standard DOMs implemented in web browsers. The book includes sophisticated examples that show you how to handle common tasks, like validating form data, working with cookies, and creating portable DHTML animations. The book also contains detailed reference sections that cover the core JavaScript API, the legacy client-side API, and the W3C standard DOM API, documenting every JavaScript object, method, property, constructor, constant, function, and event handler in those APIs. This fourth edition of the bestselling JavaScript book has been carefully updated to cover JavaScript 1.5 (ECMAScript version 3). The book also provides complete coverage of the W3C DOM standard (Level 1 and Level 2), while retaining material on the legacy Level 0 DOM for backward compatibility. "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" is a complete programmer's guide and reference manual for JavaScript. It is particularly useful for developers working with the latest standards-compliant web browsers, like Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 6, and Mozilla. HTML authors can learn how to use JavaScript to build dynamic web pages. Experienced programmers can quickly find the information they need to start writing sophisticated JavaScript programs. This book is an indispensable reference for all JavaScript programmers, regardless of experience level.},

@article{Jazayeri2007,
abstract = {A Web application is an application that is invoked with a Web browser over the Internet. Ever since 1994 when the Internet became available to the public and especially in 1995 when the World Wide Web put a usable face on the Internet, the Internet has become a platform of choice for a large number of ever-more sophisticated and innovative Web applications. In just one decade, the Web has evolved from being a repository of pages used primarily for accessing static, mostly scientific, information to a powerful platform for application development and deployment. New Web technologies, languages, and methodologies make it possible to create dynamic applications that represent a new model of cooperation and collaboration among large numbers of users. Web application development has been quick to adopt software engineering techniques of component orientation and standard components. For example, search, syndication, and tagging have become standard components of a new generation of collaborative applications and processes. Future developments in Web applications will be driven by advances in browser technology, Web Internet infrastructure, protocol standards, software engineering methods, and application trends.},

@article{Leff2001,
abstract = {The Model/View/Controller design pattern is very useful for
architecting interactive software systems. This design pattern is
partition-independent, because it is expressed in terms of an
interactive application running in a single address space. Applying the
Model/View/Controller design pattern to web-applications is therefore
complicated by the fact that current technologies encourage developers
to partition the application as early as in the design phase. Subsequent
changes to that partitioning require considerable changes to the
application's implementation-despite the fact that the application logic
has not changed. This paper introduces the concept of Flexible
Web-Application Partitioning, a programming model and implementation
infrastructure, that allows developers to apply the
Model/View/Controller design pattern in a partition-independent manner
Applications are developed and tested in a single address-space; they
can then be deployed to various client/server architectures without
changing the application's source code. In addition, partitioning
decisions can be changed without modifying the application},

PHP is a powerful scripting language designed to enable developers to create highly featured Web applications quickly and MySQL is a fast, reliable database that integrates well with PHP and is suited for dynamic Internet-based applications. PHP and MySQL Web Development show how to use these tools together to produce effective, interactive Web applications. It clearly describes the basics of the PHP language, explains how to set up and work with a MySQL database, and then shows how to use PHP to interact with the database and the server.This practical, hands-on book includes numerous examples that demonstrate common tasks such as quthenticating users, constructing a shopping cart, generating PDF documents and images dynamically, sending and managing email, facilitating user discussions, managing content, and connecting to Web services using XML.The third edition of PHP and MySQLWeb Development has been thoroughly updated, revised, and expanded to include coverage of PHP5 - including its new object model, better exception handling, and SimpleXML - as well as features introduced in MySQL, such as stored procedures.},

@book{Gamma1995,
abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk. 0201633612B07092001},
