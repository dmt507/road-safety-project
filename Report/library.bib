@article{Leff2001,
abstract = {The Model/View/Controller design pattern is very useful for
architecting interactive software systems. This design pattern is
partition-independent, because it is expressed in terms of an
interactive application running in a single address space. Applying the
Model/View/Controller design pattern to web-applications is therefore
complicated by the fact that current technologies encourage developers
to partition the application as early as in the design phase. Subsequent
changes to that partitioning require considerable changes to the
application's implementation-despite the fact that the application logic
has not changed. This paper introduces the concept of Flexible
Web-Application Partitioning, a programming model and implementation
infrastructure, that allows developers to apply the
Model/View/Controller design pattern in a partition-independent manner
Applications are developed and tested in a single address-space; they
can then be deployed to various client/server architectures without
changing the application's source code. In addition, partitioning
decisions can be changed without modifying the application},

abstract = {Defining software engineering can be a rather challenging task depending on the purpose of the definition and the intended beneficiaries. Talking about frameworks and methodologies in software engineering can be even more complex under whatever circumstances due to the many different ways in which the issues concerning frameworks, processes, approaches and methodologies have been handled. This paper explores software engineering frameworks and methodologies and related topics. The purpose of this study is to add further understanding in the area of software engineering frameworks and methodologies. Data from published literature is analysed to establish a position on the status of software engineering frameworks and methodologies. The fundamental questions to consider here are; what kind of benefits can be derived from a better understanding of these issues? Would a better understanding of frameworks and methodologies improve the way we design, develop, implement, maintain and use information systems?},

abstract = {A Web application is an application that is invoked with a Web browser over the Internet. Ever since 1994 when the Internet became available to the public and especially in 1995 when the World Wide Web put a usable face on the Internet, the Internet has become a platform of choice for a large number of ever-more sophisticated and innovative Web applications. In just one decade, the Web has evolved from being a repository of pages used primarily for accessing static, mostly scientific, information to a powerful platform for application development and deployment. New Web technologies, languages, and methodologies make it possible to create dynamic applications that represent a new model of cooperation and collaboration among large numbers of users. Web application development has been quick to adopt software engineering techniques of component orientation and standard components. For example, search, syndication, and tagging have become standard components of a new generation of collaborative applications and processes. Future developments in Web applications will be driven by advances in browser technology, Web Internet infrastructure, protocol standards, software engineering methods, and application trends.},

@book{Flanagan2006a,
abstract = {JavaScript is a powerful, object-based scripting language; JavaScript programs can be embedded directly in HTML web pages. When combined with the Document Object Model (DOM) defined by a web browser, JavaScript allows you to create Dynamic HTML content and interactive client-side web applications. JavaScript syntax is based on the popular programming languages C, C++, and Java, which makes it familiar and easy to learn for experienced programmers. At the same time, JavaScript is an interpreted scripting language, providing a flexible, forgiving programming environment in which new programmers can learn. "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" provides a thorough description of the core JavaScript language and both the legacy and standard DOMs implemented in web browsers. The book includes sophisticated examples that show you how to handle common tasks, like validating form data, working with cookies, and creating portable DHTML animations. The book also contains detailed reference sections that cover the core JavaScript API, the legacy client-side API, and the W3C standard DOM API, documenting every JavaScript object, method, property, constructor, constant, function, and event handler in those APIs. This fourth edition of the bestselling JavaScript book has been carefully updated to cover JavaScript 1.5 (ECMAScript version 3). The book also provides complete coverage of the W3C DOM standard (Level 1 and Level 2), while retaining material on the legacy Level 0 DOM for backward compatibility. "JavaScript: The Definitive Guide" is a complete programmer's guide and reference manual for JavaScript. It is particularly useful for developers working with the latest standards-compliant web browsers, like Internet Explorer 6, Netscape 6, and Mozilla. HTML authors can learn how to use JavaScript to build dynamic web pages. Experienced programmers can quickly find the information they need to start writing sophisticated JavaScript programs. This book is an indispensable reference for all JavaScript programmers, regardless of experience level.},

abstract = {Capturing a wealth of experience about the design of object-oriented software, four top-notch designers present a catalog of simple and succinct solutions to commonly occurring design problems. Previously undocumented, these 23 patterns allow designers to create more flexible, elegant, and ultimately reusable designs without having to rediscover the design solutions themselves. The authors begin by describing what patterns are and how they can help you design object-oriented software. They then go on to systematically name, explain, evaluate, and catalog recurring designs in object-oriented systems. With Design Patterns as your guide, you will learn how these important patterns fit into the software development process, and how you can leverage them to solve your own design problems most efficiently. Each pattern describes the circumstances in which it is applicable, when it can be applied in view of other design constraints, and the consequences and trade-offs of using the pattern within a larger design. All patterns are compiled from real systems and are based on real-world examples. Each pattern also includes code that demonstrates how it may be implemented in object-oriented programming languages like C++ or Smalltalk. 0201633612B07092001},

@book{Cooper2007,
abstract = {When the first edition of About Face was published in 1995, the idea of designing products based on human goals was a revolutionary concept. Thanks to the work of Alan Cooper and other pioneers, interaction design is now widely recognized as a unique and vital discipline, but our work is far from finished. This completely updated volume presents the effective and practical tools you need to design great desktop applications, Web 2.0 sites, and mobile devices. This book will teach you the principles of good product behavior and introduce you to Cooper's Goal-Directed Design method, from conducting user research to defining your product using personas and scenarios. In short, About Face 3 will show you how to design the best possible digital products and services.},
