\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Project Area and Motivation}

It is envisaged that open data, i.e. data that can be freely used and redistributed by anyone, released by governments will lead to major social and economic advances. Deloitte, one of the largest professional services firms in the world, believes that every business should have a strategy to exploit the growing estate of open data \citep{DeloitteAnalytics2012}. Furthermore, in the Open Data Charter of 18 June 2013, it is acknowledged that the use of open data can spur economic growth \citep{CabinetOffice2013}. The Open Data charter states that members of G8 are committed to releasing open data in order to create more accountable, responsive, and effective governments and businesses. Open data increases transparency about what government and businesses are doing, which promotes accountability and good governance.

The Open Data Charter also states that "freely-available government data can be used in innovative ways to create useful tools and products that help people navigate modern life more easily". It is this use of open data that forms the motivation for this project. There are already a large number of applications available that make use of various open data sets. The \textit{data.gov.uk} website has a catalogue of 350+ applications \citep{Data.go}, each of which take open datasets and make the data a usable resource for the general public. 

In this project, I will be looking at web applications with interactive maps, that make use of open data. There are several applications available in this area, but there isn't an agreed approach on how to develop such web applications. I will analyse the literature in this area, any existing applications, and the development options that are available. This will allow me to establish a suitable approach, before making my own application.

\section{Project Aims and Objectives}

The principle aim of this project is to develop and evaluate an application that allows a user to view and interact with open data via an interactive map. More specifically, I aim to build a web application that uses road safety data provided by the UK Department for Transport, in order to warn road users about accident hotspots.

I'm also aiming to build a framework that can be followed by other developers in the future, in order to simplify and encourage the development of similar applications. This will hopefully lead to more open data sets being used for the benefit of the general public.

For the planning phase of the project, I followed the steps outlined in Dawson's Projects in Computing and Information Systems \citep{Dawson2009}. As part of this process, I have identified the following high-level objectives:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Complete a literature search and review of web development options, software engineering methodologies, open data paradigm, similar applications and road safety studies.
	\item Assemble a list of SMART requirements for the project.
	\item Develop the application on a suitable platform.
	\item Evaluate technology and techniques used.
	\item Complete final report.
\end{enumerate}

These objectives have been broken down into more specific objectives, which are shown in the work breakdown structure in Appendix A. In addition to this, I created a Gantt chart in order to plan the delivery of each objective within the time constraints of the project. The Gantt chart can also be seen in Appendix A.

\section{Open Data}

The formal definition of open data states that "open data is data that can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose" \citep{OpenKnowledge}. The release of open datasets by governments is becoming increasingly popular as the benefits become more apparent.

In this section of the report, I will look at the history of the open data movement, benefits and challenges that it introduces, available open datasets, applications using road safety data, and research areas involving open data.

\subsection{The Open Data Movement}

The origins of the open data movement can be traced back as far as 1942, when Robert King Merton explained the importance of making research results freely accessible to all [3]. The term open data wasn’t coined until 1995, when an American scientific agency used it in reference to a complete and open exchange of scientific information between countries. Researchers were the first to recognise the benefits of sharing data in this manner. This concept of sharing data, along with the growing popularity of open source software led to the foundation of open data. In 2007, a meeting was held in the US, with the aim of defining the concept of open public data and have it adopted by the US presidential candidates. 

Tim O’Reilly has played a big role in the open data movement in the US. As well as being a key figure in the aforementioned 2007 meeting, he has since written about how government can improve by embracing open data.  He believes that government can learn from open-source software, by becoming “an open platform that allows people inside and outside government to innovate” [4]. 

In 2009,  the White House issued an Open Government Directive [5] requiring federal agencies to take immediate, specific steps to achieve key milestones in transparency, participation, and collaboration. On 9 May 2013, Barack Obama signed an executive order [6] that made open and machine-readable data the new default for government information. The US government has launched a number of open data initiatives aimed at scaling up open data efforts across the Health, Energy, Climate, Education, Finance, Public Safety, and Global Development sectors.

The open data movement in the UK started to pick up momentum as early as 2006, when The Guardian launched its “Free Our Data” campaign [7]. This campaign called for raw data gathered by Ordnance Survey to be made freely available for reuse by individuals and companies. This campaign partially achieved its goal when, on 1 April 2010, Ordnance Survey released the brand OS OpenData [8]. The campaign has since continued, with the aim of making more data publicly available. 

In 2009, the Prime Minister appointed the founder of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee as expert advisor on public information delivery [9]. Berners-Lee was asked to oversee the work to create a single point of access for government held public data and develop proposals to extend access to data from the wider public sector, including selecting and implementing common standards. This work led to the launch of data.gov.uk in January 2010. On launch the site contained 2,500 datasets, and it now contains over 19,500. This increase demonstrates the Open Data push that has taken place over the last few years in the UK, as the government strives to improve its openness.

The Open Data Institute
The Open Data Institute (ODI) was founded by Berners-Lee and Nigel Shadbolt in 2012. The ODI is a not-for-profit organisation, dedicated to promoting Open Data. The ODI aims to "catalyse the evolution of open data culture to create economic, environmental, and social value" [10]. In only its first year, the ODI made a big impact on the Open Data movement...
